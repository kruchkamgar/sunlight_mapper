## Notes
- apparently, people assume 1000W/m2 "light power" at 35˚ latitude: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_power_(photovoltaic)
- beyond 35˚ latitude, however, this nominal light power (theoretical maximum) should decline based on the angle of the panels—(which never situate directly under the sun) and Beer-Lambert–(out of scope)
  - sine of the angle to find ratio visible compared to equatorial locations
  - angle taken from conversion of latitude between pole and equator
    - (forgetting the season, assuming season will average to no effect)


## Schedule
- 4:40pm start?
